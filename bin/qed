# Starts a new emacsclient session. No relation to the earlier `qed` that
# inspired the `ed` program.
#
# If called from inside a tmux session, it specifies a server of the same name
# as the session; otherwise it uses the name "default". In either case, if
# there is no existing server by that name, it starts one such.
