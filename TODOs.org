* TODO automate symlinking
** TODO write a makefile
It only has to run one shell command as the default, so you only have to type ~make~ to symlink everything.
** TODO write a good backup functionality for any preexisting/conflicting config files
If ~$FILE~ exists and isn't a symlink, ask user (=y= or =n=) if they want to backup the old one and
proceed or abandon symlinking ~$FILE~. If they want to proceed, run ~mv $FILE $FILE.old~ and make the
symlink; if they don't, on to the next file.
** TODO write a shell script to symlink (with backups as needed)
